# How to Contribute to eval_ac

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :+1:

Reporting bugs
--------------

* Create a new [issue](https://github.com/WillyWallace/eval_ac/issues)
* Describe the problem and steps to reproduce it
* Suggest a fix if you can but this is not mandatory

Proposing code improvements
---------------------------

If you have a good idea how to improve the code without changing the actual outcome
of the processing, you can directly create a [pull request](https://github.com/WillyWallace/eval_ac/pulls) (PR).
Examples of these kinds of changes are, for example, better

* implementations of the helper functions
* docstrings, type hints, variable names etc.
* unit tests

Try to keep your pull requests small. This will increase the chance to be accepted.

Proposing new features
----------------------

Changes that would alter the actual outcome of the processing need to be carefully
reviewed and tested before accepting. Examples include, for example, modifications in the

* additional output
* plot layout
* other variables to plot

Also, for these kinds of proposals, you can open a new [issue](https://github.com/WillyWallace/eval_ac/issues)
where the idea can be discussed before (possible) implementation.
